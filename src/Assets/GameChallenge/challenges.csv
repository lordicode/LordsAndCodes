Moon-Wraith	"A chill mist coils around twisted binary oaks. A hollow specter drifts closer, chanting an unfinished in-order litany. Complete the sequence—or become part of the chorus."
Sawblade Sentinel	"A chrome knight drops from the rafters, revving a serrated sword. Its visor flashes: PRE ? ROOT ? POST. Feed it the right traversal codes before the blade sings."
Goblin Grenadier	"A goblin lugs an oversized powder keg, fuses sizzling. Only by siphoning the largest blast charges in perfect order can you snuff the flame and spare the village."
Sand-Cat Duelist	"A sand-hued feline warrior lounges mid-arena, scimitar glinting. “Find me—if you can,” he purrs. A balanced search of the arena tiles is your only chance to strike first."
Troll Quartermaster	"Behind warped stalls a troll tallies loot with unfair odds. Re-stack his multiset of trinkets and prove the ledger false, or pay an extortionate “storage fee.”"
Echo Puzzle Ghost	"A furious violet wraith glides in, cradling a stone cell like a trophy. Every footfall splits in two—one plunges into depth, the other fans out in breadth. Trace both echoes before the prison clangs shut around you."
Ogre Chef	"Cauldrons bubble over as an ogre chef hurls ingredients at random. Find the first flavor tossed only once, else he seasons the stew with you."
Pit of Portals	A floor of shifting tiles opens beneath you. Portals blink with changing weights. Chart the least-cost route in a heartbeat or tumble into the void forever.
Gremlin Archivist	Scrolls swirl above a candlelit desk. A gremlin archivist laughs: “Match my anagrams before the ink rearranges again!” Group the glyphs or lose the lore.
Crystal Seer	Shards of future time spin in the air. The Seer demands flawless scheduling of her prophecies; miss a deadline and time itself fractures.
Bat Swarm	"The sky blackens—hundreds of bats screech overhead. Ready your arrows and pinpoint the next shadow just left of your aim, or be drained in dusk’s embrace."
Mirror Knight	"Steel splits with a clang—the knight doubles, then doubles again. Detect the first twin among the clones before their numbers become infinite reflections."
Oracle Obelisk	"An ancient pillar glows with shifting sigils. Convert its tangled incantation into pure postfix verse, then speak the result—or the runes will explode outward."
Frost Warden	A crystal-armored giant guards the pass. Soldiers freeze mid-march unless you cleave and weave their order with treap magic faster than the blizzard howls.
Siege Engine	"A monstrous war machine rolls toward the citadel, gears grinding. Route the sappers through every weighted cog—one wrong turn and the fortress walls will fall."
